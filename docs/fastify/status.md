# Migration Status

Date: 2026-05-26

This is the live Fastify migration handoff: current pickup state,
blockers, and links to the detailed runbook.

Policy note: there are no actual Fastify users yet, so this process does
not need compatibility migrations. Update the current schema and import
paths directly instead of preserving old intermediate Fastify shapes.

Completed phase detail and old landed-slice logs live in
[`phases-completed/`](phases-completed/).

## Current Snapshot

- Active phase: Phase 9, Client thinning.
- Last landed work: 9-8c asset reference walker. The server now has a pure
  RISUSAVE asset reference helper that scans known Phase 9 server asset-id
  fields, compares references with repository asset metadata, and reports
  referenced, missing, and orphaned assets. Import responses now return
  populated asset report counts.
- Current gap: bundle export is not wired yet; exported `.risu` files still
  preserve server asset ids as JSON references only and do not include asset
  bytes.
- Next default pickup: 9-8d, bundle export route.
- Last recorded focused baselines after 9-8c: focused Fastify
  `risuSaveAssetReferences.test.ts` plus `risuSaveCodec.test.ts` passed with
  23 tests, the Fastify API suite passed with 67 files and 1157 tests, and
  `pnpm check` was clean.
  Broader baselines remain: 9-6c for full client/API test commands and
  9-5d for the last full `pnpm build`.

## Current Workstreams

| Workstream                                  | State                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removals                                    | Closed; historical detail archived.                                     |
| Fastify server foundation / storage / proxy | Closed; Fastify owns the live server path.                              |
| Server-side generation                      | Closed for `/completion`; remaining provider flattening stays deferred. |
| Server-side prompt assembly                 | Closed; closeout notes archived.                                        |
| Hypa V3 memory                              | Closed; closeout notes archived.                                        |
| Client thinning                             | Active; 9-8c landed; continue with 9-8d bundle export route.            |

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file short: last done, current blocker, next pickup, and links.
- Keep the no-compatibility-migrations policy visible while there are no
  actual Fastify users.
- Put the actionable runbook in [`status/next-steps.md`](status/next-steps.md).
- Put completed logs and old status snapshots in
  [`phases-completed/`](phases-completed/).
- Keep phase files focused on remaining work and closeout summaries, not
  landed-slice history.

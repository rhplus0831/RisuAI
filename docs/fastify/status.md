# Migration Status

Date: 2026-05-26

This is the live Fastify migration handoff: current pickup state,
blockers, and links to the detailed runbook.

Policy note: there are no actual Fastify users yet, so this process does
not need compatibility migrations. Update the current schema and import
paths directly instead of preserving old intermediate Fastify shapes.

Completed phase detail and old landed-slice logs live in
[`phases-completed/`](phases-completed/).

## Current Snapshot

- Active phase: Phase 9, Client thinning.
- Last landed work: 9-5d-iv 9-4 extension UI/API tails. Plugin V3
  theme APIs now dispatch settings commands, module integration writes
  are covered by the settings bridge, and extension command coverage was
  rechecked.
- Current gap: 9-5d has been decomposed into smaller residual
  command-replacement sub-slices before enabling the read-only
  `DBState.db` guard.
- Next default pickup: 9-5d-v, process/runtime durable-write
  classification.
- Last recorded full baselines after the 9-5d first pass: `pnpm check`
  clean, `pnpm test` 709 tests plus 4 skipped, `pnpm api:test` 1119
  tests, and `pnpm build` passing with existing CSS `::highlight`,
  browser externalization, plugin-timing, and chunk-size warnings.

| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removals                                    | Closed; historical detail archived.                                     |
| Fastify server foundation / storage / proxy | Closed; Fastify owns the live server path.                              |
| Server-side generation                      | Closed for `/completion`; remaining provider flattening stays deferred. |
| Server-side prompt assembly                 | Closed; closeout notes archived.                                        |
| Hypa V3 memory                              | Closed; closeout notes archived.                                        |
| Client thinning                             | Active; 9-5d-iv landed; continue with 9-5d-v process/runtime audit.     |

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file short: last done, current blocker, next pickup, and links.
- Keep the no-compatibility-migrations policy visible while there are no
  actual Fastify users.
- Put the actionable runbook in [`status/next-steps.md`](status/next-steps.md).
- Put completed logs and old status snapshots in
  [`phases-completed/`](phases-completed/).
- Keep phase files focused on remaining work and closeout summaries, not
  landed-slice history.

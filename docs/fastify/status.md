# Migration Status

Date: 2026-05-26

This is the live Fastify migration handoff: current pickup state,
blockers, and links to the detailed runbook.

Policy note: there are no actual Fastify users yet, so this process does
not need compatibility migrations. Update the current schema and import
paths directly instead of preserving old intermediate Fastify shapes.

Completed phase detail and old landed-slice logs live in
[`phases-completed/`](phases-completed/).

## Current Snapshot

- Active phase: Phase 9, Client thinning.
- Last landed work: 9-6b asset byte gate. Fastify-mode `loadAsset()` now
  reads server asset bytes through `/api/v1/assets/:id`, sharing the same
  server-backed byte reader as `readImage()` before local storage branches.
- Current gap: server-backed backup and restore helper/UI paths still need
  to route through the Fastify backup API instead of local backup storage.
- Next default pickup: 9-6c, server backup/restore projection.
- Last recorded full baselines after the 9-5d first pass: `pnpm check`
  clean, `pnpm test` 709 tests plus 4 skipped, `pnpm api:test` 1119
  tests, and `pnpm build` passing with existing CSS `::highlight`,
  browser externalization, plugin-timing, and chunk-size warnings.

| Workstream                                  | State                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removals                                    | Closed; historical detail archived.                                     |
| Fastify server foundation / storage / proxy | Closed; Fastify owns the live server path.                              |
| Server-side generation                      | Closed for `/completion`; remaining provider flattening stays deferred. |
| Server-side prompt assembly                 | Closed; closeout notes archived.                                        |
| Hypa V3 memory                              | Closed; closeout notes archived.                                        |
| Client thinning                             | Active; 9-6b landed; continue with 9-6c backup/restore projection.      |

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file short: last done, current blocker, next pickup, and links.
- Keep the no-compatibility-migrations policy visible while there are no
  actual Fastify users.
- Put the actionable runbook in [`status/next-steps.md`](status/next-steps.md).
- Put completed logs and old status snapshots in
  [`phases-completed/`](phases-completed/).
- Keep phase files focused on remaining work and closeout summaries, not
  landed-slice history.

# Test Suite Effectiveness Findings

Date: 2026-08-29

Status: Ledger scaffolded; no findings have been ratified.

This directory owns durable finding and decision records for the audit. Phase 0
will decide whether the working ledger remains in this index, splits into
per-phase files, or is generated from the exhaustive inventory. In every shape,
finding IDs and decisions must remain stable and reviewable after closeout.

## Finding ID Format

Use `TSA-P<phase>-<sequence>`, for example `TSA-P06-001`. A finding keeps its
original ID when implementation moves to a later phase.

## Required Finding Fields

Every finding records:

- ID, phase, primary category, and severity;
- exact test files/cases and production owner or supported contract;
- finding type: missing protection, weak assertion, self-fulfilling mock,
  duplicate evidence, obsolete contract, flake/isolation, excessive cost,
  misclassification, harness flaw, or valid retained defense in depth;
- plausible defect or invariant;
- direct evidence and counterfactual proof where required;
- companion or overlapping tests and why they are or are not equivalent;
- decision: Keep, Strengthen, Merge, Reclassify, Remove, Add, or Defer;
- implementation action, owner, dependencies, and rollback;
- validation commands and results;
- file/test-case count delta;
- state: Proposed, Confirmed, In Progress, Done, Rejected, or Deferred;
- for Deferred findings, the reason and concrete revisit condition.

## Ledger Rules

- A candidate is not a confirmed low-value test until the effectiveness rubric
  and removal proof have been applied.
- Keep Informational records for close calls, intentional defense in depth, and
  architecture-policy tests whose value would otherwise be re-litigated.
- Never delete a removal record when the test file is deleted. The record is the
  durable explanation for the count and coverage delta.
- Coverage percentage, execution success, runtime cost, or apparent duplication
  alone cannot confirm a finding.
- Do not mark a finding Done until its exact validation and inventory/status
  updates land in the same slice.

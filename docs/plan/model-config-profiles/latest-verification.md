# Latest Verification

Date: 2026-06-19

This file records the latest validation proof for the model config profiles
workstream.

## Latest Run

- Runtime/code change under test: none. This is an initial documentation plan.
- Commands:
  - `pnpm exec prettier --check 'docs/plan/model-config-profiles/**/*.md'`
  - sub-agent audit/polish pass over `docs/plan/model-config-profiles`
- Result: Prettier passed after audit corrections. Audit found phase ordering,
  secret-boundary, dynamic-catalog-anchor, and verification-matrix issues; the
  accepted corrections are incorporated in this plan.
- Residual gaps: implementation has not started.

## Remaining Proof

Future implementation phases should run the smallest focused tests listed in
each phase file, then update this file with exact commands and results.

Final closeout should include:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run src/ts/model/modelRoles.test.ts src/ts/process/request/tests/modelRoleRouting.test.ts src/ts/process/request/tests/providerCapability.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run src/ts/presetSplit.test.ts src/ts/loadout.test.ts src/ts/server/settingsBridge.svelte.test.ts src/lang/index.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run src/lib/Setting/Pages/Model/ModelRoleList.svelte.test.ts src/lib/Setting/Pages/BotSettings.svelte.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run src/ts/process/request/tests/serverCompletion.test.ts src/ts/process/request/tests/serverChat.test.ts src/ts/translator/translator.html.test.ts src/ts/process/mcp/mcp.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run --config server/fastify/vitest.config.ts server/fastify/__tests__/commands.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/providerSecrets.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/providerCapabilityRoute.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/providerTransport.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/generation.completion.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/generation.chat.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/memorySummaryModel.test.ts server/fastify/__tests__/memoryEmbeddingModel.test.ts
pnpm smoke:fastify-browser
pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.client-lib.json
pnpm exec tsc -p server/fastify/tsconfig.json --noEmit
```

Add any new focused resolver, profile-storage, preset, secret masking, and UI
commands as the implementation phases create or modify those fixtures.

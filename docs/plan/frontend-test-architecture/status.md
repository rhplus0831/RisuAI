# Frontend Test Architecture Status

Date: 2026-08-28

This is the live router for the frontend test runtime architecture workstream.
Use it first, then open only the active phase or slice. The current runner and
codebase remain authoritative until a phase lands.

## Current Snapshot

- Plan state: Phases 0-1 complete; Phase 2 in progress.
- Current phase: Phase 2 — Pure Node Promotion.
- Active slice: No implementation slice is active; the
  accessibility-source-contracts promotion slice is complete.
- Implementation state: Nine files and 62 tests have moved from the Happy-DOM
  fallback to Node across three bounded slices with no production changes.
- Blockers: None.
- Next action: Prepare the next bounded Phase 2 N-promotion slice from the
  remaining utility, validation, or serialization candidates.

## Phase Router

| Phase | State | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0](phases/phase-0-baseline-and-classification.md) | Complete | Ratified metrics, capability rules, and discovery/completeness proof. |
| [1](phases/phase-1-runtime-topology.md) | Complete | Added and piloted the Node, Svelte+Node, and Happy-DOM topology. |
| [2](phases/phase-2-pure-node-promotion.md) | In progress | Promote already-pure tests to Node in bounded domain slices. |
| [3](phases/phase-3-svelte-node-promotion.md) | Pending | Promote Svelte-compiled tests that do not require DOM behavior. |
| [4](phases/phase-4-pure-logic-extraction.md) | Pending | Extract measured pure-logic seams while retaining DOM contracts. |
| [5](phases/phase-5-dom-contract-consolidation.md) | Pending | Consolidate repeated DOM setup and clarify visible-state ownership. |
| [6](phases/phase-6-routing-and-ci-enforcement.md) | Pending | Enforce explicit routing and align affected tests, coverage, aggregate execution, and CI. |
| [7](phases/phase-7-verification-and-closeout.md) | Pending | Prove final budgets and behavior, update current docs, and archive the workstream. |

## Formal Phase 0 Baseline

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Full classified Vitest universe | 537 files |
| `test:all` ordinary frontend | 529 files / 6,413 tests |
| Warm standalone wall median | 72.30s (69.71-72.34s) |
| Warm Vitest duration median | 71.23s |
| Warm peak RSS median | 4,785,288 KiB |
| Node ordinary project | 125 files / 771 tests / 4.06s wall |
| Happy-DOM ordinary project | 404 files / 5,642 tests / 70.67s wall |
| Focused UI coverage | 6 files / 203 tests / 20.13s wall |
| Full `test:all` | 208.53s wall |
| Primary target | 57.84s ordinary frontend wall median |
| Stretch target | 50.61s ordinary frontend wall median |

The candidate inventory contains 174 N, 129 S, 234 D, and 7 B files. See
[`phase-0-classification.md`](phase-0-classification.md) for routing, setup, and
pilot decisions and [`phase-0-inventory.tsv`](phase-0-inventory.tsv) for the
per-file record.

## Phase 1 Topology Result

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Full three-project universe | 537 files: 126 N / 2 S / 409 D |
| `test:all` ordinary frontend | 529 files / 6,413 tests: 125 N / 2 S / 402 D |
| Warm wall median | 73.07s (70.44-75.22s) |
| Warm Vitest duration median | 72.05s |
| Warm peak RSS median | 4,800,148 KiB |
| Wall delta from Phase 0 | +1.1% (within 5% topology budget) |
| Peak-RSS delta from Phase 0 | +0.3% (within 10% guard) |

`frontend-svelte-node` owns the two validated S pilots through an explicit
transitional inventory. It uses Vitest's Node setup without DOM globals and
Vite's client transform so Svelte client runes such as `$effect` remain active.
The Happy-DOM fallback excludes both the N and S inventories. The checked
inventory remains exhaustive and disjoint in full, standalone ordinary, and
aggregate ordinary views; 175 unpromoted N/S candidates still require probes.

## Phase 2 Cumulative Result

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Completed slices | 3 |
| Promoted suites | 9 files / 62 tests |
| Full three-project universe | 537 files: 135 N / 2 S / 400 D |
| Standalone ordinary frontend | 535 files: 135 N / 2 S / 398 D |
| `test:all` ordinary frontend | 529 files / 6,413 tests: 134 N / 2 S / 393 D |
| Remaining target-runtime probes | 166: 39 N / 127 S |
| Latest paired ordinary wall observation | 72.99s -> 72.03s (-1.3%) |
| Latest paired ordinary peak RSS | 4,784,700 -> 4,919,184 KiB |

The paired timing is slice evidence, not a phase-level median. The -1.3% wall
movement is within ordinary run-to-run variability and is not a phase-level
performance claim. Phase 2 remains open for the remaining 39 N candidates that
still require target-project probes.

## Current Decisions

1. Use suffix routing as the end state: plain `*.test.ts` defaults to N,
   `*.svelte-node.test.ts` routes to S, Svelte/component and `*.dom.test.ts`
   files route to D, and Playwright specs remain B.
2. Retain explicit legacy inventories during migration. The generated
   classifier is evidence, not runtime routing authority.
3. Every current Happy-DOM file proposed for N or S requires a target-project
   probe before migration.
4. Keep `vitest.setup.ts` shared by N/S/D; load the Svelte plugin without DOM
   setup in S; keep Happy-DOM and the unexpected-fetch guard exclusive to D.
5. Preserve per-file isolation. Global `--no-isolate` remains rejected.
6. Use the checked exhaustive/disjoint proof for full, standalone ordinary, and
   aggregate ordinary discovery views.
7. The Phase 1 pilots validated `sentenceBreaks.test.ts` in N,
   `chatVar.svelte.test.ts` and `stores.runtimeEffects.svelte.test.ts` in S,
   and `CheckInput.svelte.test.ts` in D.
8. Reassess Phase 4 breadth after Phases 1-3. Meeting the primary target early
   narrows later extraction scope.
9. The first Phase 2 slice validated `characterSummaryProtocol.test.ts`,
   `shellProtocol.test.ts`, and `startupTelemetryProtocol.test.ts` in N without
   changing their assertions or production dependencies.
10. The second Phase 2 slice validated `util/test-all.test.ts`,
    `vitest.fetchGuard.test.ts`, and `vitest.setup.test.ts` in N while retaining
    the DOM-only fetch-guard installation for D-owned suites.
11. The third Phase 2 slice validated the three filesystem-backed accessibility
    source-policy suites in N without moving any mounted accessibility contract
    out of D.

## Accepted Observations

The first Phase 0 `test:all` attempt saw the queued-finalization browser-smoke
case time out after observing six pending effects. Its exact isolated rerun and
the complete aggregate rerun passed. Owner: generation browser-smoke. Reason
for acceptance: no Phase 0 runtime/production path touched that contract and
the final required run passed. Revisit condition: any repeat in Phase 2 blocks
the active promotion slice until investigated.

The first Phase 1 complete DOM-project run reproduced the known display-source
batching instability. The first critical request was observed before its sibling;
that failed assertion left a deferred response unresolved and held the shared
revision lane, cascading into four later failures in the same file. Three exact
focused reruns passed all 8 tests, the complete 407-file DOM rerun passed, and
the later repeated frontend lanes passed. Owner: display-source batching. Reason
for acceptance: the topology slice did not touch that production/test path, the
failure matches the pre-existing observation, and focused plus complete reruns
passed. Revisit condition: another full-lane occurrence requires a dedicated
display-source batching stabilization decision before the active promotion
slice continues.

## Latest Completed Slice

[Phase 2 accessibility source contracts](phases/slices/phase-2/accessibility-source-contracts.md)
promoted three filesystem-backed source-policy suites and 25 tests from
Happy-DOM to Node while keeping rendered accessibility contracts in the DOM
project.

## Latest Verification

See [`latest-verification.md`](latest-verification.md) for the Phase 2 focused
probe, discovery, paired timing, complete-project, frontend, affected-test, and
formatting evidence, followed by the retained Phase 1 closeout record.

## Maintenance Rules

- Update this file whenever a phase or slice changes state.
- Keep this file a router, not a chronological implementation diary.
- Put stable scope and invariants in `plan.md`.
- Put phase scope and exit criteria under `phases/`.
- Add concrete implementation/proof slices under `phases/slices/<phase>/` only
  when that phase is prepared for execution.
- Record exact commands and results in `latest-verification.md`.
- Record deferrals with an owner, reason, and revisit condition.
- Do not mark a phase complete until its exit criteria and focused validation
  pass or an exact accepted gap is recorded here.
